# Oracle Cloud Native Environment
Oracle Cloud Native Environment is a fully integrated suite for the development and management of cloud-native applications. Based on the Open Container Initiative and Cloud Native Computing Foundation standards, Oracle Cloud Native Environment delivers a simplified framework for installations, updates, upgrades and configuration of key features for orchestrating microservices. Kubernetes is used to deploy and manage containers in an Oracle Cloud Native Environment. The Kubernetes module for the Oracle Cloud Native Environment is the core module, and automatically installs and configures CRI-O, runC and Kata Containers. The term module in the Oracle Cloud Native environment refers to a packaged software component that can be deployed to provide both core and optional cluster-wide functionality
